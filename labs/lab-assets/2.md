## Step 4: Programming Languages

### Python
There are two major versions of Python active today, Python 2 and Python 3. Python 3 is the current and recommended version, however many scripts and programs were written in Python 2 and have yet to be upgraded.  Because of this, we will install both Python 2 and Python 3.

CentOS includes a version of Python 2 by default, but it is NOT the latest version of Python 2.  It is highly recommended to install the latest version of Python, however you can choose to skip this step.   

There are different options for installing Python on Linux distributions with the 2 most common being through the available package managers (ie yum or apt-get) or by compiling from source.  While using the package managers is simpler and more convenient, the versions of Python available in the common repositories is not the latest.  This makes compiling from source the suggested method for developers looking to ensure they have access to the absolute latest versions.  

#### Installation Python 2.7.14

1. Open a terminal and change into the `/usr/src` directory.  

    ```bash
    cd /usr/src
    ```

1. Use the `wget` utility to download the source code for Python 2.7. Then use the `tar` utility to extract the contents.  

    ```bash
    sudo wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.14/Python-2.7.14.tgz
    sudo tar xzf Python-2.7.14.tgz
    ```

1. Change into the newly created folder.  

    ```bash
    cd Python-2.7.14
    ```

1. Install the application by running `./configure` followed by `make altinstall`.  `altinstall` is used to maintain the default Python installation, which is recommended for system stability.  

    ```bash
    sudo ./configure
    sudo make altinstall
    ```

1. Create a new symbolic link for `python2.7.14` to run this newly installed version of Python.  

    ```bash
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/python2.7 /usr/local/bin/python2.7.14
    ```

1. Download the `get-pip.py` script that installs the `pip` module for Python.  

    ```bash
    cd /usr/src
    sudo wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
    ```

1. Run the `get-pip.py` script for the newly installed Python2.17.14.  

    ```bash
    sudo /usr/local/bin/python2.7.14 get-pip.py
    ```

#### Installation Python 3.6.5

1. Open a terminal and change into the `/usr/src` directory.  

    ```bash
    cd /usr/src
    ```

1. Use the `wget` utility to download the source code for Python 3.6. Then use the `tar` utility to extract the contents.  

    ```bash
    sudo wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.5/Python-3.6.5.tgz
    sudo tar xzf Python-3.6.5.tgz
    ```

1. Change into the newly created folder.  

    ```bash
    cd Python-3.6.5
    ```

1. Install the application by running `./configure` followed by `make altinstall`.  `altinstall` is used to maintain the default Python installation, which is recommended for system stability.  

    ```bash
    sudo ./configure
    sudo make altinstall
    ```

#### Verification Python 2 and Python 3  

1. Open a terminal and change to the users home directory.  

    ```bash
    cd ~
    ```

1. Verify Python 3 was correctly installed.

    ```bash
    python3.6 -V
    ```

    ```bash
    # Expected Output
    Python 3.6.5
    ```

1. Verify Python 2 was correctly installed.

    ```bash
    python2.7.14 -V
    ```

    ```bash
    # Expected Output
    Python 2.7.14
    ```

1. Check the version set as the "Default Python Version".  (The default version is the version of Python that is executed when you simple enter `python`).  It is expected that the default version of Python remain a Python 2.7 version.  

    ```bash
    python -V
    ```

    ```bash
    # Expected Output
    Python 2.7.5
    ```

#### Final Python Setup
Before leaving the Python setup we are going to briefly ensure that you know how to create Python Virtual Environments for each version of Python.  [Python Virtual Environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) are a method of creating isolated "environments" where specific versions of Python can be installed along with independent sets of libraries and dependencies.  

Virtual Environment usage is a very common, and recommended practice when working in Python, and you will find most other labs on DevNet encourage you to create and work within virtual environments.  

**Python 3**

1. First create a Python 3 virtual environment using the `venv` module included with Python 3.  

    ```bash
    python3.6 -m venv py3-venv
    ```

1. Now "activate" the environment. Look for the name of the virtual environment to be enclosed in parenthesis after activation.  

    ```bash
    source py3-venv/bin/activate
    ```

    ```bash
    # Expected Output
    (py3-venv) [vagrant@localhost ~]$
    ```

1. Now verify that `python` is now linked to Python 3.

    ```bash
    python -V
    ```

    ```bash
    Python 3.6.5
    ```

1. Deactivate the virtual environment.

    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

**Python 2**

1. Install the `virtualenv` package for Python within Python 2.

    ```bash
    sudo /usr/local/bin/python2.7.14 -m pip install virtualenv
    ```

    ```bash
    # Expected Output
    Collecting virtualenv
      Downloading virtualenv-15.2.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl (2.6MB)
    Installing collected packages: virtualenv
    Successfully installed virtualenv-15.2.0
    ```

1. Now create a Python 2 virtual environment using the newly installed `virtualenv` module for Python 2.  

    ```bash
    python2.7.14 -m virtualenv py2-venv
    ```

1. Now "activate" the environment. Look for the name of the virtual environment to be enclosed in parenthesis after activation.  

    ```bash
    source py2-venv/bin/activate
    ```

    ```bash
    # Expected Output
    (py2-venv) [vagrant@localhost ~]$
    ```

1. Now verify that `python` is now linked to Python 2.

    ```bash
    python -V
    ```

    ```bash
    Python 2.7.14
    ```

1. Deactivate the virtual environment.

    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

### Node
#### Installation

1. Open a terminal
1. Add the repository for Node to `yum`.

    ```bash
    curl --silent --location https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo bash -
    ```

    ```bash
    # Expected Output
    ## Installing the NodeSource Node.js 8.x repo...


    ## Inspecting system...

    + rpm -q --whatprovides redhat-release || rpm -q --whatprovides centos-release || rpm -q --whatprovides cloudlinux-release || rpm -q --whatprovides sl-release
    + uname -m

    ## Confirming "el7-x86_64" is supported...

    + curl -sLf -o /dev/null 'https://rpm.nodesource.com/pub_8.x/el/7/x86_64/nodesource-release-el7-1.noarch.rpm'

    ## Downloading release setup RPM...

    + mktemp
    + curl -sL -o '/tmp/tmp.lhj7DiVQbI' 'https://rpm.nodesource.com/pub_8.x/el/7/x86_64/nodesource-release-el7-1.noarch.rpm'

    ## Installing release setup RPM...

    + rpm -i --nosignature --force '/tmp/tmp.lhj7DiVQbI'

    ## Cleaning up...

    + rm -f '/tmp/tmp.lhj7DiVQbI'

    ## Checking for existing installations...

    + rpm -qa 'node|npm' | grep -v nodesource

    ## Run `yum install -y nodejs` (as root) to install Node.js 8.x and npm.
    ## You may also need development tools to build native addons:
    ##   `yum install -y gcc-c++ make`
    ```

1. Use `yum` to install NodeJS

    ```bash
    sudo yum install -y nodejs
    ```

#### Verification

1. Open a terminal.
2. Check the installed node version.  

    ```bash
    node -v
    ```

    ```bash
    # Expected Output
    v8.11.1
    ```
